# Bottlenecks of the Fly Brain

Max-flow / min-cut analysis of the male *Drosophila* CNS connectome, validated with in-silico ablation in a spiking (LIF) simulation.

**Question:** which neurons are structural bottlenecks between a sensory modality and the descending neurons that drive movement, and does silencing them hurt the motor response more than silencing the same number of random or high-centrality neurons?

## Data

Connectome from neuPrint (Janelia FlyEM, Cambridge, Google Connectomics), dataset `male-cns:v1.0`
(last database edit 2026-03-28, segment property update 2026-06-08).

```powershell
python src/inspect_schema.py --dataset male-cns:v1.0   # read-only schema probe
python src/ingest.py --dataset male-cns:v1.0           # cached pull; --refresh to re-pull, --report for counts only
```

The full pull takes about 10 minutes. It writes `neurons.parquet` (11 MB) and `edges/` (163 MB) to `data/raw/male-cns_v1.0/`.

| | pulled | published |
|---|---|---|
| `:Neuron` nodes | 176,422 | |
| neurons with `superclass` | 166,700 | ~166,700 |
| neuron→neuron edges | 25,862,574 | |
| synapses (sum of `weight`) | 125,024,863 | ~125M |
| synapses (sum of `weightHP`) | 107,079,478 | |

Edges kept at each synapse threshold: ≥3: 10.6M (105.0M synapses), ≥5: 6.3M (90.3M), ≥10: 2.8M (67.5M).

## Graph

```powershell
python src/graph.py --dataset male-cns:v1.0   # builds data/processed/male-cns_v1.0/
python src/eda.py --dataset male-cns:v1.0     # writes eda.json there
```

174,386 neurons with at least one edge and 25,862,452 edges (122 self-loops dropped). `weightHR` equals `weight` on every edge, so it is not kept. The whole graph loads as a sparse matrix in about 1 s and takes 208 MB. At ≥5 synapses it takes 51 MB.

**Neurotransmitter sign** (`consensusNt`, by presynaptic neuron): acetylcholine = excitatory; GABA, glutamate and histamine = inhibitory; dopamine, serotonin, octopamine and unclear = no sign. That gives a known sign for 93.9% of neurons. 59% of synapses are cholinergic, and those form the excitatory subgraph. These are predictions, not measurements. Median prediction confidence is 0.96 for ACh, 0.86 for GABA and 0.81 for glutamate. `consensusNt` agrees with the per-neuron `predictedNt` for 88.4% of neurons. Glutamate is inhibitory at most central synapses but not all.

Caveat for the excitatory subgraph: all 6,093 photoreceptors (`ol_sensory`) are histaminergic, so an ACh-only graph has no edges leaving the visual sensory set.

## Source and sink sets

```powershell
python src/sets.py --dataset male-cns:v1.0   # writes sets.parquet and sets_report.json (with Neuroglancer spot-check links)
```

Sources come from the `class` / `subclass` / `superclass` annotations (definitions in `src/sets.py`). Sinks are the 1,314 neurons with `superclass == descending_neuron`; motor neurons (815) are kept as an alternative readout.

| modality | neurons | output synapses | share going directly to DNs | median hops to DNs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| vision (photoreceptors) | 6,086 | 684,494 | 0.0% | 3 |
| olfaction (ORNs) | 2,639 | 1,364,154 | 0.04% | 2 |
| taste, head | 275 | 169,010 | 3.4% | 2 |
| taste, legs/wings | 1,153 | 540,333 | 2.1% | 2 |
| Johnston's organ | 512 | 231,113 | 15.9% | 2 |
| head mechanosensory (all) | 1,652 | 576,636 | 21.5% | 2 |
| touch, body | 2,558 | 1,395,875 | 1.6% | 2 |
| proprioception | 1,454 | 1,005,570 | 1.7% | 2 |
| hygrosensation | 66 | 55,757 | 1.0% | 2 |
| thermosensation | 25 | 50,522 | 0.9% | 2 |

From every modality, all 1,314 descending neurons can be reached.

## Max-flow / min-cut

```powershell
python -m pytest tests -q                    # solvers vs known cuts and vs networkx
python src/flow.py --dataset male-cns:v1.0   # ~25 min, mostly the 50 random ablations per pathway
python src/viz.py --dataset male-cns:v1.0    # reports/bottleneck_3d.html (interactive 3D)
```

**Solvers.** OR-Tools, scipy (Dinic) and igraph give identical flow values. On the full graph OR-Tools and scipy take 1–5 s per cut and igraph about 5× longer. OR-Tools is the default.

**Finding 1: cutting to all descending neurons says nothing.** The minimum node cut between a modality and all 1,314 descending neurons is just its first relay layer:

| modality | node cut, full graph | share of the cut that is a direct partner of the sensory neurons |
|---|---|---|
| taste, head | 1,399 | 100% |
| olfaction | 1,142 | 99% |
| Johnston's organ | 2,200 | 100% |
| vision | 12,454 | 7% (the cut sits 2–4 hops deep, at the optic-lobe output) |

The CNS is shallow (median 2 hops from any sense to a descending neuron) and fans out immediately.

**Main analysis: single identified targets.** Node cut with unit capacity, on edges that carry ≥1% of the postsynaptic neuron's input. Direct source→target synapses are excluded.

| pathway | cut (full graph) | cut (≥1% input) | synapse flow left on the full graph after removing k cut neurons | same k, path betweenness | same k, random on-path (n=50) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| photoreceptors → giant fiber (DNp01) | 1,267 (LPLC2 185, LC4 126) | 21 | 83% | 94% | 99.99% ± 0.04 |
| head taste → MN9 (proboscis) | 355 | 34 | 24% | 64% | 99.98% ± 0.16 |

PageRank and out-strength top-k remove nothing (100% left).

- **The full-graph cut for vision → giant fiber is dominated by LPLC2 and LC4.** These are the visual projection neurons known experimentally to drive looming escape through the giant fiber.
- **Robustness.** Synapse thresholds barely matter: at ≥1% input, the cut at ≥3, ≥5 and ≥10 synapses has Jaccard 1.0 (taste at ≥10: 0.94). The input-share threshold matters more. Against the ≥1% cut, the ≥0.5% cut has Jaccard 0.34 (vision) and 0.57 (taste). At ≥2%, vision no longer reaches the giant fiber at all.

**Caveat.** A per-edge input-share filter breaks pathways built from many small inputs that converge. For example, an LPLC2 cell has a median of 553 presynaptic partners, only 3 of which provide ≥1% of its input. None of the 33,409 T4/T5→LPLC2 edges reaches 1%, although T4/T5 together provide at least a fifth of LPLC2's input. That is why LPLC2/LC4 appear in the full-graph cut but not in the ≥1% cut. A cell-type-level graph (summing edges per type pair) is the natural next step.
